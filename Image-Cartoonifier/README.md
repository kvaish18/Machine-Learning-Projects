# Cartoonify an Image with OpenCV in Python

Do you miss your childhood? Yes, everyone does.! So today let’s head towards giving our pictures some cartoonic effects. This article is all about building a photo cartoonifyer using Python and OpenCV

## What is OpenCV?
Python is the pool of libraries. It has numerous libraries for real-world applications. One such library is OpenCV. OpenCV is a cross-platform library used for Computer Vision. It includes applications like video and image capturing and processing. It is majorly used in image transformation, object detection, face recognition, and many other stunning applications.

## What are we going to build?
At the end of this article, we aim to transform images into its cartoon. Yes, we will CARTOONIFY the images. Thus, we will build a python application that will transform an image into its cartoon using OpenCV.

We aim to build an application which looks like:

Let’s head toward creating something CREATIVE.
