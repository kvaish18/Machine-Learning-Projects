# Smile-Selfie-Capture
Everyone loves a smiling picture, so we will develop a project which will capture images every time you smile. This is a simple machine learning project for beginners and we will use openCV library.

### What is OpenCV?
OpenCV is an open-source library for computer vision, with a focus on real-time applications. It focuses mainly on video capture/processing, image processing, and analysis (like face and object detection). It has many built-in functions and pre-trained models, so we donâ€™t have to worry about training and testing of algorithms.

### Project Prerequisites
To implement this project we need to know the following :

1. Basic concepts of Python
2. openCV basics.

#### To install the library, you can use pip installer from the command line:
##### pip install opencv-python
