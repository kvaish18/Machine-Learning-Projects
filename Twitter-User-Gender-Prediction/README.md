# Twitter-User-Gender-Prediction
Problem Statement : 
For a given dataset (problem) which is the best classification algorithm (as per accuracy)
Students need to work on Ensemble Learning (modelling) for a given problem. 
 Pick up a dataset of your choice or the one attached with mail (Preferable) 
Ask any two questions on the dataset of your choice and provide answers for the same. 
For instance for the given dataset questions can be as follows.

Q1) What are the most common emotions/words used by Males and Females?
Q2) Which gender makes more typos in their tweets?

Take up three classification algorithms of your own choice and build three respective Machine learning models. Compare the Accuracy of all three and suggest which ML algorithms suits best for the given problem.

NOTE  : For the given dataset "Gender" will be your dependent variable.

Evaluation will be done on following points:

1)  Exploratory data analysis (with visualization) and Data Cleaning if required
2) Questions asked on dataset and answers for the same with brief explanation  
3) Feature Selection and feature Engineering if required depending on the dataset
4) Ensemble Machine learning Modelling (3 Classification Algorithms)
5) Accuracy calculation 
6) Summarised write up at the end
